# React Challenge

Simple 2-3 Challenge for training path course - Perficient

## Description
You're going to build a simple TODO List App, it should allow every [CRUD](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CRUD) Operation. 

Most of the operations will be implemented on client-side, others will just have to be mocked using [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/docs/api/rest).

It is recommended that you use some kind of library that already includes UX friendly components as for example [Ant Design](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce) / [Material UI](https://mui.com/) does.


## Requirements
 - TypeScript
 - You're going to create a [Github](www.github.com)  Repo
 - Testing -> Recommended using Jest/Enzyme
 - HTTP Requests using [Axios](https://github.com/simoneb/axios-hooks) set of hooks
 - There are no requirements for Design, however, it is quite important that you style your components and challenge over it yourself. You can use any framework/library to accomplish this.
 - [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) Is required, so for now we won't use on this Challenge Next JS
 - It is important that you try to build more than one route in order to see if your react router configuration is working appropriately
 - To manage global state use [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)
 - Try to use as much as possible every React available API set of hooks (be aware of it's appropriate use, don't use them just for the sake of it).
 - Would be good if you are able to build a custom hook, however, there are no special requirements for this (just useful if you want to practice it)
 - There are no requirements / name convention for branching, however, i think this is a good exercise for you to practice this important topic along the development of it.
